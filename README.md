## Network Control Center Technician (U.S. Air Force)
#### 1. Created an automated patch workflow using PowerShell/Batch scripting, slashing compliance times by 83% and halving the manpower required, transforming Misawa AB into a MAJCOM leader in security readiness.
> |   |   |
> |---|---|
> | S | The base’s patching process was highly manual, requiring a large team and resulting in delayed compliance that left critical vulnerabilities unaddressed. |
> | T | I needed to automate workflows and reduce the team’s workload while achieving faster, more consistent patch compliance. |
> | A | Leveraging self-taught PowerShell and Batch scripting skills, I developed a robust automation toolset that integrated real-time vulnerability scanning, automated reporting, and streamlined deployment steps in collaboration with security teams. |
> | R | Enabled highly parallel deployments enabling staff from working 5-10 systems at a time to dozens at a team and refduced patching time from 20-30 labor minutes to 1-2 labor minutes. |

#### 2. Lead a migration team supporting the comprehensive domain migration to AFIN, coordinating with multiple teams and achieving a seamless deployment recognized as “Best to Date” by senior leadership.
> |   |   |
> |---|---| 
> | S | The base needed to integrate its local domain into the Air Force Intra-Network (AFIN), a large-scale project requiring coordination among multiple teams to meet strict security and operational requirements. |
> | T | I was designated as a team lead the migration effort, ensuring minimal downtime, successful domain integration, and adherence to Air Force best practices. |
> | A | Organized cross-functional workgroups, developed a detailed migration roadmap, validated each phase through sandbox testing, and enforced security standards during the transition. |
> | R | Completed the migration ahead of schedule with zero unplanned downtime, praised by Higher Headquarters Communications & Information Director as the “Best to Date” AFIN domain integration. |

#### 3. Proactively developed and deployed a custom batch-based solution to fix a widespread Tumbleweed patch issue, restoring full operations for 500+ systems and enabling PACAF-wide remediation.  
> |   |   |
> |---|---|
> | S | The entire PACAF MAJCOM inadvertently deployed an invalid Tumbleweed Desktop Validator patch, breaking email and web browsing across the entire network. |
> | T | I recognized the critical outage and took immediate action to find a workable fix that could be rapidly deployed at the base level. |
> | A | Developed a custom batch tool to remove or replace the invalid patch on all affected systems, then coordinated a quick rollout to 500+ machines. After testing, I submitted the fix to the 83rd NOC for MAJCOM-wide deployment. |
> | R | Restored full email and web connectivity faster than any other base in PACAF; my solution was adopted MAJCOM-wide, resolving a major Pacific Air Force systems outage. |

#### 4. Collaborated with Applications team to refine SCCM collections, building a robust profiling system enabling root cause and trend analysis capabilities across a 10k-system network, improving SCCM performance by 17%.  
> |   |   |
> |---|---|
> | S | The security application team struggled to analyze SCCM agent performance across a 10,000-system environment, causing missed patch windows and frequent communication failures. |
> | T | I was tasked with refining SCCM collections and building a robust profiling system to enable root-cause analysis and trend monitoring. |
> | A | Collaborated with the Applications team to design advanced collection queries, integrate real-time agent health checks, and develop interactive dashboards highlighting key performance metrics. |
> | R | Improved overall SCCM performance by 17% and significantly reduced unresolved agent communication issues, allowing teams to pinpoint root causes faster and boost patch compliance network-wide. |

#### 5. Built a PowerShell-driven file migration utility, transferring 500GB of shared data with zero loss and minimal downtime, significantly streamlining the overall domain migration process.  
> |   |   |
> |---|---|
> | S | The base required a large-scale file server transition—migrating 500GB of shared data—during the domain migration without causing major downtime or losing crucial files. |
> | T | I was tasked with creating a reliable, efficient process to transfer all files and folders while preserving permissions and user access. |
> | A | Developed a custom PowerShell migration tool that automatically validated file integrity, replicated folder structures, and preserved security ACLs. Scheduled off-peak runs to minimize user disruption and generated detailed logs for error tracking. |
> | R | Completed the 500GB data migration smoothly and ahead of schedule, with zero data loss and minimal downtime, expediting the domain transition and ensuring uninterrupted access to shared resources. |
